Welcome to HBCD_SYMRI_POSTPROC's documentation!
===============================================

This tool is used in the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) study
following the conversion of QALAS acquisitions to T1, T2, and PD maps.
The purpose of the tool is to take quantitative maps, register them to
either raw T1w or T2w images where anatomical segmentations have already
been performed, and then extract quantitative values from the segmentations.
